        Project Intro Outside Pittsburgh, Allegheny Land Trust protected 124
        acres of woodlands from rapid encroaching residential development in
        southeastern Allegheny County. The 40 year old maple, cherry and
        oak-hickory forest provides habitat for deer, turkey, and many species
        of birds. Hikers, birders, and mountain bikers will be able to explore
        the area, and possibly catch a glimpse of a majestic 200 year old oak
        tree.
